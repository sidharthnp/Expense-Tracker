### ✅ Explanation for README

* `tk` → installs the `tkinter` bindings (sometimes comes pre-installed with Python on Windows, but better to include for completeness).
* `ttkthemes` → for themed Tkinter styling.
* `pandas` → for handling expense data in tabular form.
* `matplotlib` → for charts (e.g., expense visualization).
* `pillow` → for image handling (`PIL.Image` and `ImageTk`).

---

⚠️ Note:

* On **some systems**, `tkinter` is bundled with Python and doesn’t need `pip install tk`.
